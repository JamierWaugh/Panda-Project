Newcastle University CSC1034: Project 1
===
This is my first project at Newcastle University.

How to use the software:
---
There are many command line operations available to this project, they are:
* "--no-rotate" - This operation stops the camera from spinning and thus keeps a still frame on the walking panda
* "--scale=x" - This operation scales the panda by any float input.
* "--no-walk" - This operation stops the panda from walking - letting the user get a better view.
* "--baby-panda" - This operation creates a second, baby panda in the scene.
* "--baby-no-rotate" - This operation creates a second, baby panda and also stops the camera rotation keeping both animals on screen.
* If you chose to not use any command line operations, the program will run with a single, walking panda and a rotating camera.
